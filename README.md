# Overview:
Space Company is a science-fiction incremental game where you start from humble beginnings on Earth, working your way up to travelling between star systems and building Dyson Spheres and pretty much colonising the entire galaxy(ies?)

This is a rework from [Space Company](https://sparticle999.github.io/SpaceCompany/)

# Monetization policy
Although things are subject to change we have tentatively decided on the following policies:
* No ads
** Ads can leads to a lower user experience, migue1s will be covering any costs instead of relying on them
* iAP
** Content progression should not be locked via iAP, for now we plan quality-of-life improvements only.
** iAP should not make the game feel pay-to-win, everything should be doable without them

Any funds collected through these will be used (in order):
1. Cover any costs of hosting the apps
2. Sponsor + cover costs of online saves
3. Support migue1s (lead of the mobile rework) and sparticle999 (original owner) :)
